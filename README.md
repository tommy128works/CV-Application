## Project Description

Create a CV application at your convenience!

This project's functionality relied on the proper implementation of React States and Props.

Overall, this was a great learning experience for creating apps using React. I found that using React led to much more clean and readable code than compared to using JavaScript to generate HTML. 

Most notably, EventListeners for a component can be written and called in the same place as the HTML element instead of needing to:
1. Append the HTML element to the DOM
1. Query for the HTML element
1. Add EventListeners to the HTML element  

Technologies Used:
- React
- JSX
- JavaScript
- CSS

Notable Coding Techniques Used:
- React Components
- React States
- React Props
